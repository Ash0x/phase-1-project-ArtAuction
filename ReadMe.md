Phase-1 Project Proposal—

Art Auction from the Metro Art Museum 

Our website is a space for users to bid on art from the Metropolitan Art Museum. The webpage will show pictures of different works of art, and when you click on one, it gives you the information about the artist and the piece. 

There will be a form and a submit button where people can bid their price on the piece. It will show the highest bidder, and the price amount.

If the bidder wins (submits a certain price), a pop-up will say “Congratulations, you’ve won this piece” and the picture of the piece will pop up.
