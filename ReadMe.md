Phase-1 Project Proposal— “Art Auctioneer”

Our website offers the rare opportunity for users to purchase art from the Metropolitan Art Museum. The webpage shows pictures of different works of art from the museum, and when the "View Details" button is clicked, information about the artist and the piece will display in a modal. 

Users can search the collection by Artist Name or Artist Piece, and if an invalid input is received, the user will see the message, “No results found. Please try again.” If a valid input is received, only the pieces of art searched for appear on the webpage. 

There is also a form where users can insert a bidding price and “bid” on the piece by clicking the “bid” button. If the user bids higher than the current bidding price, the current bidding price will be replaced with the text “Your Bid Price: (input price)” in green. 

If the input price is below the current bid price, a message will appear saying “Your bid must be higher than the current bid!”

If a user inputs a price higher than the listed Buyout Price, a message will say, “You won the auction for ${input price}!” 

Once a piece is purchased, the Buyout price will be replaced with the text “SOLD!”. Once a piece is sold, the bidding form will disappear, to prevent a user from bidding on a piece that is already sold.
